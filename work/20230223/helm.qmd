ChatGPT HELM 설치 과정 설명

This script installs Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Here's what each line does:

curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null: This line downloads a GPG key from https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc, which is used to sign the Helm packages. The key is then decrypted and saved as /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg.
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes: This line installs the apt-transport-https package, which allows apt-get to retrieve packages over HTTPS.
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list: This line adds a new package repository to apt-get, which points to the Helm stable repository hosted at https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/. The tee command writes the repository information to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list.
sudo apt-get update: This line updates the package list from the newly added repository.
sudo apt-get install helm: This line installs the helm package using apt-get.
Overall, this script downloads the GPG key used to sign the Helm packages, adds a new package repository to apt-get that points to the Helm stable repository, updates the package list, and finally installs the helm package.
